we see nothing when follow TLS

With TLS/SSL decryption, you need:

Private key .key corresponding to the server in the packet (you have picopico.key).

The packet must use RSA key exchange (TLS 1.2 or lower) â†’ because from TLS 1.3 it cannot be decrypted with private key.

In the RSA Keys List section
