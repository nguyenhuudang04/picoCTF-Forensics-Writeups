Description
The judge for these pictures is a real fan of antiques. Can you age this photo to the specifications?
Set the timestamps on this picture to 1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00 with as much precision as possible for each timestamp. In this example, +00:00 is a timezone adjustment. Any timezone is acceptable as long as the time is equivalent. As an example, this timestamp is acceptable as well: 1969:12:31 19:00:00.001-05:00. For timestamps without a timezone adjustment, put them in GMT time (+00:00). The checker program provides the timestamp needed for each.
