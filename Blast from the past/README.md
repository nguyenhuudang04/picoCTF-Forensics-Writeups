üï∞Ô∏è picoCTF - Blast from the past


Description
The judge for these pictures is a real fan of antiques. Can you age this photo to the specifications?
Set the timestamps on this picture to 1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00 with as much precision as possible for each timestamp. In this example, +00:00 is a timezone adjustment. Any timezone is acceptable as long as the time is equivalent. As an example, this timestamp is acceptable as well: 1969:12:31 19:00:00.001-05:00. For timestamps without a timezone adjustment, put them in GMT time (+00:00). The checker program provides the timestamp needed for each.

- Next, we will set time for immage:
  exiftool \
  -DateTimeOriginal="1970:01:01 00:00:00" \
  -CreateDate="1970:01:01 00:00:00" \
  -ModifyDate="1970:01:01 00:00:00" \
  -TrackCreateDate="1970:01:01 00:00:00+00:00" \
  -MediaCreateDate="1970:01:01 00:00:00+00:00" \

As seen in the checker, we failed because the Samsung-specific tag Time Stamp still had the original value.

So let‚Äôs fix it manually!

 we can see ofset of Samsung: TimeStamp is 31 37 30 30 35 31 33 31 38 31 34 32 30  
we will change it to " 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 31 "
