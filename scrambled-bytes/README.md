Description
I sent my secret flag over the wires, but the bytes got all mixed up!

Each byte in the input file is XORed with a random value in [0, 255]

Then the order is shuffled using random.shuffle

Finally sent over UDP, using a random source port

If we know random.seed(...), we can:

Restore the shuffle order

Regenerate the XOR key sequence

Decode and rearrange the flags in the correct order

Find the time of calling random.seed(...) = timestamp of the first packet = 1614044650.913789387 . send = 1614044650

This script is used to decode a scrambled and XOR-encoded data string, recorded in the network file capture.pcapng.

The original data is sent via UDP packets, each byte has been:

XORed with a random value

Randomly position-shuffled

All based on a random.seed(...) from the timestamp.

Step-by-step Explanation (English)

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Check the file type

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Rename the file to have a .png extension

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: View the image
